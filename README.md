This is a BlackJack game I learnt to build along with the instructor Per Borgen while doing a freeCodeCamp JavaScript Full programming course on YouTube.
This course is very amazing as you are able to learn concepts while building some amazing projects. Check out their course on youtube: https://youtu.be/jS4aFq5-91M
